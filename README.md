## UNIVERSAL SYSTEM MANAGEMENT RULES OF SURVIVAL

- All computer users must know how to...

1. Securely backup and restore our personal account data.

2. Restore and update our computer operating system.

3. Install new applications and update them.

- Before launching into what tools like

* [bash](pages/bash-shell-basics.md)
* [git](pages/git-basics.md)
* [python3](pages/python3-basics.md)  

- can do for us, and how they work, we shall address our valid concerns **IN FULL**.

* WE WILL NOT speak to how to do anything wrong, often referred to giving us enough rope to hang ourselves.

* WE WILL speak to how to both correct and prevent such outcomes,  
starting with the most severe outcomes, and will work our way to increasingly less severe.

- FOR EMPHASIS:  The likelihood of this doing any damage to hardware or software is nil.  The costs are $0.
